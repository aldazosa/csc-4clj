;; 82. Word Chains
;;
;; URL: http://www.4clojure.com/problem/82
;;
;; Description:
;; A word chain consists of a set of words ordered so that each word differs by only one letter from the words directly before and after it.  The one letter difference can be either an insertion, a deletion, or a substitution.  Here is an example word chain:<br/><br/>cat -> cot -> coat -> oat -> hat -> hot -> hog -> dog<br/><br/>Write a function which takes a sequence of words, and returns true if they can be arranged into one continous word chain, and false if they cannot.
