;;
;; URL: http://www.4clojure.com/problem/77
;;
;; Description:
;; Write a function which finds all the anagrams in a vector of words.  A word x is an anagram of word y if all the letters in x can be rearranged in a different order to form y.  Your function should return a set of sets, where each sub-set is a group of words which are anagrams of each other.  Each sub-set should have at least two words.  Words without any anagrams should not be included in the result.
