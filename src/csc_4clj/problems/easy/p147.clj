;; 147. Pascal's Trapezoid
;;
;; URL: http://www.4clojure.com/problem/147
;;
;; Description:
;; <p>Write a function that, for any given input vector of numbers, returns an infinite lazy sequence of vectors, where each next one is constructed from the previous following the rules used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle">Pascal's Triangle</a>. For example, for [3 1 2], the next row is [3 4 3 2].</p>
;;<p>Beware of arithmetic overflow! In clojure (since version 1.3 in 2011), if you use an arithmetic operator like + and the result is too large to fit into a 64-bit integer, an exception is thrown. You can use +' to indicate that you would rather overflow into Clojure's slower, arbitrary-precision bigint.</p>
